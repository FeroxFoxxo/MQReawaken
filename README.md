### This server is completely free of intellectual property from the original game. If you see infringing code, please let me know and I will take it down to be rewritten.

MQReawaken is a private server meant for educational use only. It's built off the Ultima server emulator, written by the guys at [ServUO](https://github.com/ServUO/ServUO/), and heavily modified.

**This project is for non-commercial, educational use only.**

I am completely unaffiliated with any prior remake attempts. This has just been a project to progress my own knowledge of C#.

#### Requeriments

- Visual Studio 2022.
- .NET Core 6.
- The orignal game, as well as the accompanying asset bundles that it uses.

#### How to use

- Compile and run the server using Visual Studio 2022.

#### Versioning

Automatic versioning is planned for the future, but at the moment the version number needs to be manually updated in the ``.csproject`` file. The system to update the version numbers goes as follows:

|Number|Description|
|--:|:--|
|Major|Only updated by the repository administrators once a completely new version is deployed.|
|Minor|Updated once a batch of features (or a [project](https://github.com/Frostrix/MQReawakened/projects)) is fully implemented.|
|Patch|Updated once a new feature is added.|
